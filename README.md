//This is an activity that I did for my college requirement. Submitted on Sep 22,2022.

//Below are the instructions given by our professor:

“Gatas ng Kalabaw”, a dairy product company, hired you as a programmer. Your job is to write a program that will sell their products on-line over the Internet (yup, this is E-commerce!).  Currently, the company sells pasteurized milk and ice cream.  For the meantime, pasteurized milk are packaged in a bottle, each bottle costs 15.25 pesos.  Ice cream comes in half-gallon size only, which is priced at 100.00 pesos.  To attract more customers, the company gives a five percent discount (on milk purchase only) to customers who buy at least 10 bottle of milk.  Also, customers who buy at least 3 cans of ice cream are given seven percent discount on their ice-cream purchase (discount not applicable to milk purchase).

Your program should ask the customer the following information:
  - The number of bottles of milk and
  - The number of ice cream cans to purchase. Input zero if you will not purchase the product and
  - Combined total of these items.
